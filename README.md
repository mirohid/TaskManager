This Interactive Task Manager is a SwiftUI 5-based iOS app that allows users to add, edit, view, filter, sort, and delete tasks with a modern and intuitive UI. It supports priority-based task management, Core Data persistence, and dynamic sorting (by due date, priority, or title). Users can tap a task to view details, edit tasks in a sheet, and swipe to delete. The app is fully optimized with smooth animations, accessibility features, and a clean, responsive design.
